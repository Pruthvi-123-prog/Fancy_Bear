Website Vulnerability Scanner Report(Light)
The Light Website Scanner didn't check for critical issues like SQLi, XSS, Command Injection, XXE, etc. Upgrade to run Deep scanswith
40+ tests and detect more vulnerabilities.

Findings
 Missing security header: Strict-Transport-Security
port 443/tcp
URL Evidence
https://www.example.com/
Response headers do not include the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security header
Request / Response
 Details
Risk description:
The risk is that lack of this header permits an attacker to force a victim user to initiate a clear-text HTTP connection to the server, thus
CONFIRMED

opening the possibility to eavesdrop on the network traffic and extract sensitive information (e.g. session cookies).
Recommendation:
The Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header should be sent with each HTTPS response. The syntax is as follows:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<seconds>[; includeSubDomains]
The parameter max-age gives the time frame for requirement of HTTPS in seconds and should be chosen quite high, e.g. several months.
A value below 7776000 is considered as too low by this scanner check.
The flag includeSubDomains defines that the policy applies also for sub domains of the sender of the response.
Classification:
CWE : CWE-693
OWASP Top 10 - 2017 : A6 - Security Misconfiguration
OWASP Top 10 - 2021 : A5 - Security Misconfiguration
 Missing security header: Content-Security-Policy
port 443/tcp
URL Evidence
https://www.example.com/
Response does not include the HTTP Content-Security-Policy security header or meta tag
Request / Response
 Details
Risk description:
The risk is that if the target application is vulnerable to XSS, lack of this header makes it easily exploitable by attackers.
Recommendation:
Configure the Content-Security-Header to be sent with each HTTP response in order to apply the specific policies needed by the
application.

 Missing security header: Referrer-Policy
port 443/tcp
URL Evidence
https://www.example.com/
Response headers do not include the Referrer-Policy HTTP security header as well as the <meta> tag with name
'referrer' is not present in the response.
Request / Response
 Details
Risk description:
The risk is that if a user visits a web page (e.g. "http://example.com/pricing/") and clicks on a link from that page going to e.g.
"https://www.google.com", the browser will send to Google the full originating URL in the Referer header, assuming the Referrer-Policy
header is not set. The originating URL could be considered sensitive information and it could be used for user tracking.
Recommendation:
The Referrer-Policy header should be configured on the server side to avoid user tracking and inadvertent information leakage. The value
no-referrer of this header instructs the browser to omit the Referer header entirely.

 Missing security header: X-Content-Type-Options
port 443/tcp
URL Evidence
https://www.example.com/
Response headers do not include the X-Content-Type-Options HTTP security header
Request / Response
 Details
Risk description:
The risk is that lack of this header could make possible attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting or phishing in Internet Explorer browsers.
Recommendation:
We recommend setting the X-Content-Type-Options header such as X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff .

 Details
Risk description:
The risk is that an attacker could use this information to mount specific attacks against the identified software type and version.
Recommendation:
We recommend you to eliminate the information which permits the identification of software platform, technology, server and operating
system: HTTP server headers, HTML meta information, etc.

 Security.txt file is missing
port 443/tcp
URL
Missing: https://www.example.com/.well-known/security.txt
 Details
Risk description:
There is no particular risk in not having a security.txt file for your server. However, this file is important because it offers a designated
channel for reporting vulnerabilities and security issues.
Recommendation:
We recommend you to implement the security.txt file according to the standard, in order to allow researchers or users report any security
issues they find, improving the defensive mechanisms of your server.
